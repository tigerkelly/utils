# Utils library.  General C functions.

These functions are common functions I use a lot, enjoy.

### Building utils library.

I have compiled these are several different type of OSes but this has only been tested on Raspberry Pi.

These are pretty much simple C code that should compile without any issues.

To build just type **make** and the libraries will be placed in the **libs** directory.


### Description of each library.

	- ini - Is a set of functions to support .ini type files.  I use this a lot for storing and retriving configuration data for a program or system.
