/*
 * strqtok - extract successive tokens from a string, allowing quotes
 *
 * strqtok works just like strtok (), except that individual tokens may
 * be surrounded by single or double quotes.
 *
 * strqtok considers the string s1 to consist of zero or more text tokens
 * separated by spans of one or more chars from the separator string s2.
 * The first call (with s1 specified) returns a pointer to the first
 * char of the first token, and will have written a null char into s1
 * immediately following the returned token. If the token was surrounded
 * by single or double quotes, they are stripped. The function keeps
 * track of its position in the string between separate calls, so that on
 * subsequent calls (which must be made with s1 equal to NULL) will work
 * thru the string s1 until no tokens remain. The separator string s2 may
 * be differnt from call to call. When no token remains in s1, a NULL
 * pointer is returned.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the extracted token, or NULL if no more tokens
 * remain in the string.
