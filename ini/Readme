This directory contains a library called libini.a
See src/libini.txt file for more info.

This static library allows the programmer to create and/or read .ini type files.

An ini file looks like:

[Section 1]
    key1 = value1
    key2 = value2

[Section 2]
    key1 = value1
    key2 = value1
    key3 = value3
